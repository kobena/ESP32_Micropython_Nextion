# ESP32_Micropython_Nextion
Control Nextion display using Micropython on ESP32

Kobena Wiredu here. I love the ESP32,Micropython and Nextion displays
for Embedded Projects although I am new to Python/Micropython.

This project provide the ESP32/Micropython equivalent of the project in 
https://randomnerdtutorials.com/nextion-display-with-arduino-getting-started/
which uses the Arduino Framework.

1. Flash the Nextion display with the .tft file. Note i use NX4024K032 Enhanced model
2. Go through the main code for the pin connection.
